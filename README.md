## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned about overflow property in CSS which is very useful for the mobile application UI.

```css
 .flex-container {
      overflow: scroll;
    }
```

### Continued development

From this project, I think I still need to learn how to use semantic tags and relative units (rem, em, ...). And I need to work upon my CSS skills and upgrade it to the next level.

### Useful resources

- [Media screen property for more than one screen](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_mediaqueries_flex) - This helped me in making the UI for mobile screen. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
